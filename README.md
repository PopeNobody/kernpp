# kernpp
A c++ library that runs right on top of the Linux kernel.

First, let's be clear, I'm doing this on a lark.  I don't know if it
will be useful to me or to anyone long term.  I am experimenting on some
ideas for c++ code without the huge libc baggage.  I would like to try
some different things, and I figure I might as well do it publicly.
I appreciate suggestions, but this is my project to fuck around.
I might not do it the right way because I am interested in discovering
the characteristics of the wrongness produced by doing it the wrong way.
